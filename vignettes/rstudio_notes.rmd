## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


The following function displays packages that are loaded in the R environment.
```{r}
my_packages <- library()$results[,1]
head(my_packages, 10)
```
```{r}
my_packages
```
```{r}
library(Rtools)
```
To install `phyloch` we will use the package `devtools`.
```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then we can install `phyloch` from Github.
```{r eval= FALSE}
devtools::install_github("fmichonneau/phyloch")
#ERROR: lazy loading failed for package 'phyloch'
#* removing 'C:/Users/randy/OneDrive/Documents/R/win-library/4.0/phyloch'
```
