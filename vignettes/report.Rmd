# **My Report**

## *Overview*

  In this report I use the OpenTree of life alongside Physcraper to create and access an updated phylogentic tree of all bats.

  There are over 1000 different species of bats. These extraordinary flying mammals use their hands to fly; granted their order name *chiroptera*, which translates in Greek to 'Hand Wings'. Each of their fingers are connected to one another through a thin layer of skin which allows these nocturnal mammals to take off into flight. Chiroptera are the only mammals with the capability of continued flight.
